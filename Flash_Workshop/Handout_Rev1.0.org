** NAND Flash Explained (yaa)
*** [[~/UMJI/Flash_Workshop/assets/FTL.jpg][FTL]] (Flash Translation Layer)
This layer maintains a mapping between $\textbf{PBA} \Rightarrow \textbf{LBA}$.
*** [[~/UMJI/Flash_Workshop/assets/nand_structure.png][Physical Structure]]
**** Package(Chip) >> Die >> Plane >> Block(Sector) >> Page >> Cell
*Typically or by default*, *Page* is the *minimal unit of Programme*, while *Block* is the *minimal unit of Erase*
These are physical allocation of *cells*, aimed for
**** So let's focus on "Cell"
***** Structure

****** How is 0 & 1 defined
***** Operations
****** Read [[~/UMJI/Flash_Workshop/assets/read_0.png][0]]/[[~/UMJI/Flash_Workshop/assets/read_1.png][1]]
****** Programme [[~/UMJI/Flash_Workshop/assets/programme_0.png][1->0]] (Fowler-Nordheim Tunneling)
****** Erase [[~/UMJI/Flash_Workshop/assets/erase_1.png][0->1]]
***** There R [[~/UMJI/Flash_Workshop/assets/types.png]["Types"]] (SLC/MLC/TLC/QLC, etc.)
*** Logical Operations on Larger Scale
**** Programme by ?
**** Read by ?
**** Erase by ?
*** Questions that may worth your attention
***** Is the logic of operation-by-part physically irreplacable?
Nope. These behaviors are wholly defined by *FTL*.
***** Is it beneficial, with any cost?
(Yes, parallel block-wise 'erase saves wait-time before 'programme thus improves 'programme process. Cost -> Wearing off problem.)
***** Wearing off problem: which process damages the cells? How to optimize?
(P/E Loops, destructive to the oxide in MOSFET.)
***** Where is the FTL/mapping stored?
*OP* (Over Provisioning, sectors spared in the flash)
***** Benefits of FTL & OP?
Provide "backup" cells (simple modification of mapping)
*Wear levelling*
OP stores FTL mapping
Write amplification (never mind)
***** Implementation of Multi-Layer-Cell
Single FG, multiple threshold voltage, up to amount of charge loaded in FG.
***** Density at the cost of life-span, why?

** Flash_disk Concepts Explained (whc)
